🚦 Usage
1. Start the Detector
Run the detector on the target machine (e.g., your Kali Linux VM):
Bash
sudo python3 detector.py
2. Run the Stress Test
Simulate traffic from your host machine (Windows) to test the detection logic:
Bash
python attack_sim.py

📊 How it Works
The tool operates in a three-step pipeline:
Ingestion: Captures raw packets in 5-second windows.
Feature Extraction: Extracts metadata such as Source IP, Protocol, and PPS.
Classification: Compares traffic patterns against a threshold (or ML model) to trigger alerts.
